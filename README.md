# Word Length Mapper: A Python Dictionary Comprehension Example

This repository contains a Python script that takes a sentence as input, splits it into words, and maps each word to its length using a dictionary comprehension. This simple script is an excellent demonstration of dictionary comprehensions, string manipulation, and basic input handling in Python.

## Description

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Takes user input:** 
    - The user inputs a sentence, which is then split into individual words.

2. **Processes the input:** 
    - A dictionary comprehension is used to create a dictionary where each word in the sentence is a key, and its corresponding value is the length of that word.

3. **Outputs the result:** 
    - The script prints the resulting dictionary, showing each word and its length.

### How It Works

1. **User Input:**
    - The user is prompted to enter a sentence. The input sentence is split into a list of words.

2. **Dictionary Comprehension:**
    - The script iterates over the list of words and creates a dictionary where each word is associated with its length.

3. **Output:**
    - The dictionary, with words as keys and their respective lengths as values, is printed.

### Example

**Input:**

```bash
This is a sample sentence
